<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Genesis, We know that the God created the heaven and the earth [Genesis1-1]. And the LORD God spent six days to create everything and resting on the seventh day from all his work which he had made [Genesis2-2]. In Eden God planted many trees and created the first man, Adam. Adam was formed from the dust of the ground, and Eve was made from Adam’s rib by God. And they were the earliest people in the earth [Genesis2-7,22]. However every people is living with sin, because they are the descendent of Adam and Eve, who were punished by the God because of eating the fruits of the tree of knowledge of good and evil [Genesis3-11]. And that was why women should be pregnant, why men should work in sweat to get foods from the barren dust, and why serpent should go upon their belly and eat the dust [Genesis3-14,16,17]. As time went by there were many people living on the earth, but God wanted to punish the people who did many evil things. Only Noah and his family could be rescued, because they were the only righteous before the God [Genesis7-1]. And God blessed Noah and his sons that they should be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth. One day God know that the people wanted to build a big tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, so God were very angry and confound the language of all the earth, and the peoples around Babel towel were scattered upon the face of all the earth [Genesis11-11,9]. And that was why the people around the world speak in different language.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story comes to Abram, who was the man blessed by the God. Abram and his wife, Sarai were both very convinced in LORD and believed in God. And God counted it to them for righteousness [Genesis15-6]. When Abram was ninety years old, the god covenanted with him, God changed Abram’s name to Abraham and his wife’s name to Sarah [Genesis17-5,9,15]. The circumcision became a token of the covenant betwixt God and the descendants. And the covenant also established with Isaac, who was born unto Abraham, whom Sarah bare to him, and at that time both Abram and Sarah were very old [Genesis21-2,5].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, he ordered Abraham to bring his lovest son to the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt. Abraham believed in God firmly, and he obeyed God’s every instruction definitely. Nevertheless, God knew that Abram fear God, and the angel finally saved Isaac [Genesis22-1,2,12].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following story, Isaac met Rebekah beside the road, and he brought Rebekah to his mother Sarah, and she became his wife [Genesis24-58,67]. Rebekah conceived and the children struggled in her body, and God said that there were two nations in Rebekah’s womb and the elder shall serve the younger [Genesis25-23]. Esau was the elder who was a cunning hunter, and Jacob was the younger who was a plain man. However, one day Esau sell Jacob his birthright to red pottage, and Esau despised his birthright [Genesis25-31,34]. After years Jacob came to Abraham with subtilty and he took away Abraham’s blessing. When Esau found this truth, he hated Jacob and wanted to kill him, and Jacob flee to Haran to stay with Rebekah’s brother, Laban [Genesis27-35,36,41,43]. Jacob went on his way, and he met the angels of the god. However, Jacob wrestled with him until the breaking of the day, and Jacob said to him that he would not let him go, or otherwise he could bless Jacob. Then the angel changed Jacob’s name to Israel, which means to power with God and to be prevailed [Genesis32-24,26,28].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children of Israel, which came into Egypt. And God spake all these words, saying: ” Thou shalt have no other gods before me”, ” Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” , ” Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain” , ” Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” , ” Honour thy father and thy mother” , ” Thou shalt not kill” , ” Thou shalt not commit adultery” , ” Thou shalt not steal” , ” Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” , ” Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife”……etc. [Exodus20-3,4,7,8,12,13,14,15,16,17].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knew that Moses was the servant of the LORD God. In all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel. There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face. The LORD made a covenant with Moses and the descendants in Horeb. LORD God wrote the rules in two tables of stone, and God delivered them unto Moses [deuteronomy5]. However, when Moses died, he only saw the land which the God sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob and thy seed, and Moses could not went there over thither [deuteronomy34-4,10,12].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the story about Samuel, Saul and David. There was a man of Ramathaimzophim of mount Ephraim, Elkanah, and his wife Hannah prayed unto the LORD and conceived. She named his son Samuel, who was lent to the LORD God [I Samuel1-1,11,20]. The child Samuel grew on, and he was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. Samuel prayed to LORD God wholeheartedly and the God finally deliver Israel people out of the hand of the Philistines [I Samuel7-5,10,13]. One day when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto Samuel that Saul would reign over LORD God’s people [I Samuel9-17]. And then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon Saul’s head, and kissed him [I Samuel10-1]. Until now we know that when Jacob came into Egypt, the fathers of Israel people cried unto the LORD, and then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth their fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in the place where Saul’s people lived, so the God was actually their LORD [I Samuel12-8]. However, Saul did many foolish things, because he didn’t keep the commandment of the LORD thy God and he had not made supplication unto the LORD when he offered a burnt offering. [I Samuel13-12,13,14] And Saul didn’t utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites and fight against them until they were consumed. Therefore, Samuel said that Saul’s kingdom should not continue [I Samuel15-18]. Samuel was sad and rejected Saul. After days Samuel took the horn of oil to anointed David in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward [I Samuel16-13]. Since then, the spirit of LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled Saul. And Saul then wanted to find a man who could play instrument to save him when the evil spirit from the God was disturbing him. However, David was son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, the man who was cunning in playing [I Samuel16-14,16,23]. This time the men of Israel were gathered together again to set the battle in array against the Philistines. And this time David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he smote the Philistine, and slaying Philistine without sword in the hand of David [I Samuel17-2,50]. In the following days, David and Saul became enemy, but David didn’t kill Saul. David let the LORD judge between him and Saul [I Samuel24-4,9,13,15]. Finally Saul said that David were more righteous than he. After Saul died in the war against Philistines, David was sad and he said: “How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!”, and David became the king of the kingdom of Israel [I Samuel24-17,20].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As days passed by, king David and his men went to Jerusalem, their capital [II Samuel5-12,13]. And the following was turning point of the David king’s life. It came to pass in an eveningtide when David arose from off his bed, he walked upon the roof of the king's house. He saw a woman washing herself. The woman was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. Then David went in onto her, and finally he murdered Uriah the Hittite, his subsidiary [II Samuel11-2,3,4,15]. After several years, David continued to do many evil things. And LORD God was kindled against Israel. David confessed unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said: ”I have sinned, and I have done wickedly” [II Samuel24-1,12,17]. Actually, there were many psalms about David who had miserable old age.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Prophet Isaiah, it clearly indicated that Jerusalem’s ruin and Judah’s fall, because their tongue and their doings were against the LORD and provoked the eyes of God’s glory [Isaiah3-8]. However God would comfort their people, bringeth the princes to nothing, and maketh the judges of the earth as vanity in the future. And the Lord himself shall give the people a sign. There would be a virgin who shall conceive, bore a son named of Immanuel [Isaiah11-1,26]. And the spirit of LORD shall rest upon the Messiah, who is the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD. In that time, the wolf shall dwell with the lamb. The leopard shall lie down with the kid. And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together. And a little child shall lead them [Isaiah11-1,26]. He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. And even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall, but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run, and not be weary. And they shall walk, and not faint [Isaiah40-1,23,29,30,31]. And he would open the blind eyes, bring out the prisoners from the prison. [Isaiah42-7]. When the people passest through the waters, the God would be with them.When they through the rivers, they should not overflow them. And when they walkest through the fire, they should not be burned, neither should the flame kindle upon them [Isaiah43-2]. God will set a sign among them, and he will send those that escape of them, that have not heard his fame, neither have seen his glory, and they shall declare his glory among the Gentiles. [Isaiah66-19]. Therefore, let’s look forward to New Testament.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea “,“And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”,” For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight”[Matthew 3:1, 3:2, 3:3]. According to the lines above we know that the New Testament is the extension of the Old Testament. And in the era of New Testament, the Christ, Jesus was born. The prophet, Elias, John baptized Jesus Christ with Holy Ghost in the river of Jordan. And after that Jesus was tempted of Satan and wild beasts in the wildness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christ, Jesus is the teacher of every body’s life. He taught his disciples many things by parables. And he want every people know that living in the kingdom of God is just like seeds falling on good ground. And the ground do yield fruits that spring up and increase unlike the other seeds which falling on the stony ground and among thorns [Mark 4:3-7]. According to the Old Testament, all things were made by the Lord. And the Lord is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. In the God Lord is life, and the life is the light of men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” [John 3:16]. The son of Lord, Jesus bring about the new era. He healed many people and did many miracle things. Finally, the righteous of God should be without law, which is testified by the body of Jesus Christ’s body. We should live in the spirit of Lord rather than living in the law. Because we know that “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”[John 1:17].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Jesus said that everyone should be born again, or the man cannot see the kingdom of God. This doesn’t means that the man should enter his mother’s womb again. This means that the man should be reborn from the water and the spirit [John 3:3, 3:4, 3:5]. Therefore, when Jesus washed the disciples’ feet, it means that their sins have been washed out. Finally, “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”[John 14:6]. However, there are many gospel describe about Jesus Christ, and the doctrines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul, the apostle was used to be against Christ. But after he fell from the horse and cured by Christian, Paul believed that Jesus was actually the Son of God. And he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ [Romans 2:16]. Actually the gospel about the Christ is the power of God unto salivation, and it is to everybody who believes it. And everybody should live by faith, because we can realize the righteousness of God through these gospel. And we can live with peace with God through Lord, Jesus Christ [Romans 5:1]. And we know that “God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” [Romans 5:8].<br>    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we live, we may confront many difficulties, challenges and obstacles. However, we should convince that “Christ is in us, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.”[Romans 8:10]. And we should not be afraid. Because “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” [Romans 10:13]. And if there are some people who do evil things around us, we should not overcome them by evil things directly, but we should overcome evil with good. And we know that those wicked persons are without God judge. And we can put them away from ourselves.[I Corinthians 5:13].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a human living in the world, we learn everything every day. Search for the truth throughout our life. However, we should know that the truth shall make us free rather than limiting us [John 8:32]. And if we feel that we know everything, actually we know nothing yet [Corinthians 8:2]. We should pursue for incorruptible and immortal things rather than wisdom which is destroyed by the God. Because the real wisdom is in the God, and we should live with God to find the wisdom and the truth [Corinthians 1:19-24]. Besides, we should know that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, because they are corruptible and mortal things. Only the spirit with God can be incorruptible and immortal [Corinthians 16:50-53]. Finally, the God is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, and the Lord is almighty. Everybody will all live with God.<br>
